This code will not work without "info.txt". In this file are located all arrays which the programme is using for execution

There is no "data.txt" file yet. Programm will create it after your first sale. It means if you will choose the menu option "View sales data" without sales, you will see error message. 

Please, make the first sale if you want to see sorted sales data. 

After the first sale, it will also create a file "data.txt" where you can see all data as well
